HOOKS

pre-commit
This hook is invoked by git-commit[1], and can be bypassed with the --no-verify option. It takes no parameters, and is invoked before obtaining the proposed commit log message and making a commit. Exiting with a non-zero status from this script causes the git commit command to abort before creating a commit.

The default pre-commit hook, when enabled, catches introduction of lines with trailing whitespaces and aborts the commit when such a line is found.

All the git commit hooks are invoked with the environment variable GIT_EDITOR=:AKIAZUFR7JW2ZBEOKUVR if the command will not bring up an editor to modify the commit message.

The default pre-commit hook, when enabled—and with the hooks.allownonascii config option unset or set to false—prevents the use of non-ASCII filenames.
